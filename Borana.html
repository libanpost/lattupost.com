    <br>The Borana Gutu (Oromo: Borana) is one of the two major subgroups of the Oromo people. They live in the Borena Zone of the Oromia Region of Ethiopia and the former Northern Frontier District (now northern Kenya) of Northern Kenya.
    <br> They speak a dialect of Oromo.The Borana people are notable for practicing Gada system without interruption.
    <br>The Borana speak Oromo, which is part of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic large languages family.The Borana people were traditionally a culturally homogeneous society with genealogical ties.
    <br>The Borana communities governed themselves in accordance with gada(literally "era"), a limited democratic socio-political system long before the 16th century,
    <br> when major three  party wars commenced between them and the Christian kingdom to their north and Islamic sultanates to their east and south.
    <br> The Gadaa system elected males from five Borana miseensa (groups), for a period of eight years, for various judicial, political, ritual and religious roles.
    <br> Retirement was compulsory after the eight year term, and each major clan followed the same gadaa system.
    <br> Under gadaa, every eight years, the Boran would choose by consensus an Abbaa Bokkuu responsible for justice, peace, judicial and ritual processes, an Abbaa Duulaa responsible as the war leader and other positions.
    <br>The Borana characterize one of largest of the Cushitic groups occupying the Horn of Africa. Their physical features, culture, language and other confirm clearly the fact that they are native to this part of Africa. The Borana tribe is a section of a major group known as oromo. There are two sub-groups – sabo,and gona.
    <br>The word spelled Borana is pronounced with the final vowel silent. It refers to the people or their language and also means “friend” or “kind person”. Thus, a bad person may be told he is not Borana.
    <br> Borana people are the oldest of the group Oromo, living on the border between Ethiopia and Kenya.
    <br>They are semi-nomadic herders, The Borana women wear a head scarf colorful coverings and beautiful necklaces.
   <br>Oromo divided into two sub-groups such as borana and barentu.
