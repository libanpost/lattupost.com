   <h1  ><font facing="Georgia"  color="#67360D" > The three bulls: </font></h1>
<h4 align-spacing="4">
  <br> There were three bulls living together. Their colors were white, black and brown. They always stay together day and night. 
  <br>  A hyena was bothered to separate them because he is afraid of them while they are together. One day he paved the way to eat them separetly.
  <br> He approached the black and brown bulls and said to them, “you have to be separated from the white bull because the wild animal can easily
  <br>  see him from a distance and may eat you because of him” They believed that and separate the white bull from themslves. Then the hyena ate 
  <br>  the white bull. Another, time the hyena approached the black bull and said “don’t go with this brown bull because you have a good color 
  <br> you cannot be seen from a distance but because of this brown bull the wild animal will see you and eat you like he ate the white bull.”
  <br>  Believing what the hyena said, the black bull separeted from the brown one. The hyena ate both of them separetely.
